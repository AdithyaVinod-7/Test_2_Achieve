The amount of time a teacher spends grading student work can vary widely depending on factors such as the size of the class, the number of assignments, the complexity of the assignments, and the teacher's own grading practices. On average, a teacher may spend anywhere from a few minutes to several hours grading each student's work, with the average being around 30-60 minutes per student per assignment. However, in certain cases, the grading process can take much longer, particularly for more complex or open-ended assignments that require a more detailed review and evaluation. 

Additionally, for online classes, where the volume of the student's submission is larger, the time spent on grading can be more. In addition, typing allows students to produce more in response to questions and eases the editing process, making answers potentially completer and more accurate. Computerizing assessment allows instructors to administer quizzes and tests that are flexible, easy to customize, and quick and efficient to grade.

Course-management software such as Blackboard, Moodle, and Canvas are widely used in the United States and can be used as a data corpus for an AI-based examination system. This system can help instructors administer assessments such as quizzes and tests that have descriptive and open-ended answers along with the ability to grade these assessments. This can be beneficial for educators as it allows them to focus more on teaching and less on grading as well as give fair and consistent assessment results for students.





An AI-based descriptive examination system can be used to automatically score answers for several reasons:
1.	It can save time and resources by eliminating the need for manual grading. 
2.	It can provide more objective and consistent scoring, as the AI model can be trained to look for specific characteristics in the answers that indicate a certain level of understanding or mastery of the subject matter. 
3.	It can help to reduce the potential for human bias in the scoring process. 
4.	It can handle large volumes of data and reduce the error rate of manual grading. 

Overall, an AI-based descriptive examination system can provide more efficient, accurate, and fair evaluation of student performance.
